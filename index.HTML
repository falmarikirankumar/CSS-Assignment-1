    <h3><em>What is CSS ?</em></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br />
        <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in other media.</li><br />
        <li><b id="mide-text-line" style="text-decoration:line-through;">Css is not neccesary </b>
            <b class="bgcolor">Css saves a lot of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at
            once
        </li>
        <br />
        <li><i>External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</i></li><br />
    </ol>

    <h2><em>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</em></h2>
    <ul class="space">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li>Internal -by using style elements in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However,<b class="bgcolor"> in
                this tutorial we
                will use inline and internal styles,</b> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to
            try it
            yourself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the
        other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link
        directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has
        been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target
        elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
